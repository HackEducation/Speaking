              <p>This talk was presented at Coventry University as part of my visiting fellowship at the Disruptive Media Learning Lab. I was asked to speak about the "top ed-tech trends" -- my research, my thoughts on what I happening in education technology. Spoiler alert: mostly it's not the tech that we should be talking about....</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at The University of Edinburgh. Ostensibly it's a talk about automation, artificial intelligence, and education technology, but as I wrote it, it also became a talk about autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. What sort of future is one where the model for learning is "the driverless university"?...</p>
